# PennLabs-Front-End-Interview
My coding project for my PennLabs interview!

The assignment was to create a navigation bar, a form, and an interactive shopping cart.

My navigation bar consists of a progress bar on the left and page options on the right that change color when hovered over. 
The "Categories" item has a cool little animation of an arrow, which could be taken as a drop-down menu.

The form uses Bootstrap to handle even column spacing. Each input has an interactive border feature, and the submit button looks cool too.
Notice that the placeholder text disappears when a user clicks.

The shopping cart has its own separate Javascript file for toggling between the cart and the button. The button has a notification showing
the status of the cart. Once clicked, the display is toggled, and the cart appears. 

The next thing I'd like to handle would be better tolerance for window resizing.
